## Introduction

This project contains Jupyter Notebook implementations of various machine learning algorithms with detailed explanations. Each algorithm is accompanied by:
- A theoretical explanation: what the algorithm is, why it's used, how it works, and how it's measured.
- Practical implementation using Python and popular libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.
- Visualization of the results to help understand the behavior of the algorithm.

## Algorithms

### Linear Regression
**What:** Linear Regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
**Why:** It is used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the value(s) of the independent variable(s).
**How:** It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
**Measured by:** The goodness of fit is measured by R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
**What:** Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning model used for classification and regression analysis.
**Why:** It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is still effective when the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
**How:** It finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.
**Measured by:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, etc.

### Naive Bayes
**What:** Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.
**Why:** It is used for text classification, spam filtering, and sentiment analysis.
**How:** It calculates the probability of each class based on the given features and selects the class with the highest probability.
**Measured by:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, etc.

### Logistic Regression
**What:** Logistic Regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome.
**Why:** It is used for binary classification problems.
**How:** It models the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class.
**Measured by:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
**What:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm.
**Why:** It is used for classification and regression tasks.
**How:** It assigns a class to a sample based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
**Measured by:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, etc.

### Decision Tree
**What:** Decision Trees are used for classification and regression tasks.
**Why:** They are easy to understand and interpret.
**How:** They work by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features. This process is repeated recursively to build a tree.
**Measured by:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, etc.

### Random Forest
**What:** Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training.
**Why:** It improves the accuracy and reduces the risk of overfitting.
**How:** The output is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
**Measured by:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, etc.

### Gradient Boosting
**What:** Gradient Boosting is an ensemble technique that builds models sequentially.
**Why:** Each new model corrects the errors of the previous models.
**How:** It is widely used for classification and regression tasks due to its high predictive accuracy.
**Measured by:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, etc.

### K-Means
**What:** K-Means is a clustering algorithm that partitions the dataset into K distinct clusters.
**Why:** It is used for exploratory data analysis and pattern recognition.
**How:** It minimizes the variance within each cluster.
**Measured by:** Sum of Squared Distances (SSD), silhouette score, etc.

### DBSCAN
**What:** DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm.
**Why:** It can find arbitrarily shaped clusters and is robust to noise.
**How:** It groups together points that are close to each other based on a distance measurement and a minimum number of points.
**Measured by:** Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, etc.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**What:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique.
**Why:** It is used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets, increasing interpretability while minimizing information loss.
**How:** It transforms the data into a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by any projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.
**Measured by:** Explained variance ratio, Scree plot, etc.
